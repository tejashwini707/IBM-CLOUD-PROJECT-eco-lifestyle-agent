# 🌱 Eco Lifestyle Agent

**Empowering Sustainable Living with AI — Powered by IBM Watsonx.ai and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The **Eco Lifestyle Agent** is an intelligent AI assistant designed to help users adopt environmentally responsible habits through personalized, actionable guidance. Using a combination of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Watsonx.ai**, the agent provides real-time eco-friendly tips, local recycling rules, and green lifestyle suggestions.

Users can ask natural questions like:
- “How can I reduce plastic use at home?”
- “What are eco-friendly travel options in my city?”
- “Are there any government schemes for sustainable farming?”

## 🛠️ System Architecture

1. **Data Source Aggregation**  
   Collect and structure eco-relevant data from trusted environmental sources.

2. **Embedding & Indexing**  
   Generate vector embeddings and store them in a searchable vector database.

3. **RAG Pipeline**  
   - **Retriever**: Retrieves semantically relevant data.
   - **Generator**: Watsonx.ai LLM generates an intelligent response.

4. **Frontend**  
   Web-based UI allowing users to interact with the system naturally.

5. **Deployment**  
   Hosted using IBM Cloud Lite and Watsonx Runtime for scalability.
