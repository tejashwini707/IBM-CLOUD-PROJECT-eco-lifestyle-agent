# 🌱 Eco Lifestyle Agent

**Empowering Sustainable Living with AI — Powered by IBM Watsonx.ai and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The **Eco Lifestyle Agent** is an intelligent AI assistant designed to help users adopt environmentally responsible habits through personalized, actionable guidance. Using a combination of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Watsonx.ai**, the agent provides real-time eco-friendly tips, local recycling rules, and green lifestyle suggestions.

Users can ask natural questions like:
- “How can I reduce plastic use at home?”
- “What are eco-friendly travel options in my city?”
- “Are there any government schemes for sustainable farming?”
